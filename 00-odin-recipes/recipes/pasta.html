<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  Pasta is a staple of Italian cuisine, made primarily from durum wheat flour
  mixed with water or eggs. It comes in many shapes and sizes, each suited to
  different types of sauces and cooking methods. Pasta can be served hot or cold
  and is enjoyed worldwide for its versatility, simplicity, and comforting
  taste.

  Popular types of pasta include spaghetti, penne, fusilli, macaroni, and
  lasagna sheets, among many others. It pairs well with a variety of sauces—from
  simple tomato-based sauces and creamy Alfredo to rich meat ragùs and fresh
  pesto. Pasta dishes are often garnished with cheese, herbs, and vegetables to
  create flavorful meals for any occasion.
